With all the popular golf patterns that get talked about, packaged into techniques, and sold by teachers with insta and youtube videos, which of those patterns should I pick that will lead to the highest plateau, the highest ceiling? Or, going even further, are there completely different patterns that noobdy uses in the golf world currently uses that lead to even _higher_ ceilings? If golf has been around for so long, can anyone find completely different ways of playing?

### Different ways of playing other games

One of the easiest example in sports from recent times that show different ways of playing are possible is the Steph Curry / Warriors' affect on the 3 pointer and changing the way games in the NBA are played. We all know him now as the leader in NBA 3 pointers made, but it's fun to look back on [discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/13ztwkt/this_post_from_nearly_12_years_ago_discussing/) about whether someone can beat Ray Allen's career 3 point record.

In 2014 Steph set the record for 3s in a season, broke that in 2015, and 2016 with staggering amounts. In this case, Steph led the way showing that 3s can be made at a higher rate, and doing so will help your teams win. We can see that by [looking at the record for most 3s in a season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_season.html) and see how the top 20 are all after 2014. Other players might have tried this before, but Steph and the Warriors showed the league that 3s are makeable and doing that does lead to team improvements.

Finding different ways to play also occur in non-athletic games as well, which can be shown by early AI's influence on backgammon. A system named TD-gammon came out in 1992, and was one of the frst game successes using neural nets. Backgammon is complex enough to where there are certain strategies that people use, but at a much smaller scale than chess, or Go, which took AI systems and computing power longer to beat. A [paper describing TD-gammon](https://www.bkgm.com/articles/tesauro/tdl.html) talks through results. The AI could beat humans, and moreover, found an opening strategy that was not used by players.

> As one might expect from such favorable assessments, TD-Gammon has had a rather significant impact on the human expert backgammon community. TD-Gammon's style of play frequently differs from traditional human strategies, and in at least some cases, its approach appears to give better results. This has led in some cases to major revisions in the positional thinking of top human players. One important area where this has occurred, illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 2, is in opening play. For example, with an opening roll of 2-1, 4-1, or 5-1, the near-universal choice of experts over the last 30 years has been to move a single checker from the 6 point to the 5 point. This technique, known as "slotting," boldly risks a high probability of being hit in exchange for the opportunity to quickly develop a menacing position if missed. However, when Bill Robertie's article on TD-Gammon appeared in Inside Backgammon in 1992, it included a rollout analysis by TD-Gammon showing that the opening slot was inferior to splitting the back checkers with 24-23. As a result, a few top players began experimenting with the split play, and after some notable tournament successes, it quickly gathered more adherents. Today, the near-universal choice is now the split play, whereas the slotting play has virtually disappeared from tournament competition.

Backgammon has been played for centuries and at the competitive level. There are books about strategy, how to win, and everyone agreed on the best style of play. Suddenly some new system comes along, learns technique from scratch, and finds that the strategy that's been used by the top players isn't ideal. Within a couple years, everyone plays by what the computer suggests.

### Kids are an Untrained Intellegence

[Chess was the next game to be beaten](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/chess-ai) in 1996, with the Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue. After that the game of Go became the final, most complex game to win using AI. There's a really great (documentary)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y] of how Lee Sadol was beaten by AlphaGo (seriously, great use of an hour and a half watching a screen. I absolutely recommend watching it). The way AlphaGo was built was by first showing the system examples of games played by high level players. After having that base, it then played itself over and over to find possible new patterns of winning. After that showed success by the Sadol matches, they started even fresher with (AlphaGo Zero)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero#Training], a model that started from only knowing the rules of the game and could find even better patterns of winning, without starting human informations. [And it did](https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220157/https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/).

We're not yet at a point of being able to create a GolfSwing Zero system that takes the human body structure and find what the best pattern of rotation with a club in hand to hit a ball would be. But we can geet close.

If you tell a kid to take a heavy club, grip however they like, and swing as hard as they can to hit a ball, they'll be able to come up with a good way of doing it. As they get older though, they're brought to teachers who can easily then take away that original method because it doesn't match what's accepted by the golf community. It's unfortunate that we don't look at kids learning to swing on their own and learn from them. Maybe we should give [kids who learn on their own some credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJhV-Sk2Xzk) for their ability to learn, and not think that we know better than them, just like AI.
